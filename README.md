Welcome to Bad Buck! Bad Buck is a top down 2d game created with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game consist of a home page providing the user with instructions on how to play the game as well as three levels, with each level increasing in difficulty. The game allows the user to move the rabbit around the main game area avoiding moving enemies and boundries which will hinder the rabbits progress if a collision takes place. The aim of each level is to get the rabbit to collect 20 carrots that appear at different locations within the game area whilst avoiding any contact with enemies or hitting boundries.

## Wireframes

The wireframes below Where created at the beginnig of this project with a mobile first approach in mind. The aim was to keep the design as simple as possible so as not to take away from the experience that the game itself would provide. These wire frames where created with a software called [JustInMind](https://www.justinmind.com/)

## Colour Scheme
The colour scheme I have choosen for this website is losely based on [this](https://www.schemecolor.com/wp-content/themes/colorsite/include/cc5.php?color0=92cd28&color1=b6ee56&color2=e4ff7f&color3=ffa33f&color4=f78914&pn=Orange%20&%20Green) I wanted to keep the colour scheme simple and related to the subject of the game. As the goal of the game is for the rabbit to catch a carrott I felt it appropriate to use orange and green as the main color scheme for the website.

## Structue
The structure of the website was kept as simple as possible as the main focus of the site was the user experience during the game play.
The site has a home page which contains two section, the first being the instructions on how to play the game and the second allowing the user to start the gamw.
Once the game is complete the user is presented with either the [you win screen](https://github.com/Shaun-Finnegan/Shaun-Finnegam-Milestone-project-2/blob/main/assets/Readme-images/you-win-tablet.png?raw=true) or the [game over screen](https://github.com/Shaun-Finnegan/Shaun-Finnegam-Milestone-project-2/blob/main/assets/Readme-images/game-over-mobile.png?raw=true) depending on the outcome of the game.
If the user wins they are presented with the option to move on to the next level. However if they lose they are presented with the option to start again via the New Game button.

## Features

### Main Game Logo
This logo was deaigned using a software solution called [Placeit](https://placeit.net/) and is designed to convey the origional idea for the game theme which is based on the antics of my mischevious pet rabbit.

### How To Play Button
This button appears on the home page and when clicked reveals the instructions for how to play the game. Then once the close button is clicked the instructions disappear.

### Start Button
This is the button that allows the user to start the game play once they have read the instructions.

### Main Game Play Area
This was created using HTML canvas it is designed to be responsive on any device. The canvas is where all the game play happens.

### Player Score
The score feature keeps count of how many times the rabbit catches the carrot. If the score equals 20 before the time runs out or the user loses all their lives then they have won the game.

### Time left/ Countdown
The timer feature counts down in seconds from 60. If the users score is less than 20 when the timer counts down to 0 then the game is over.

### Lives Left
The application also keeps count of the players lives. If the rabbit collides with one of the moving foxes then the player loses a life. If the players lives counter equals 0 before the player has achieved 20 points then the game is over.

### Mobile Game Controls
One of the goals of this project was to allow users to play the game on any device. One of the ways this was achieved was to add mobile controls on devices below a certain screen size.

### Time Running Out Game Screen
To add aditional suspence to the game once the timer gets to 10 seconds left the game screen turns red and audio of a clock counting down begins to play. This will stop if either the players score gets to 20 or the timer runs out or the player loses all of their lives.

### Gain additional lives with Super Brocoli
This feature was added towards the end of the development phase of this project. there will be a period in each level of the game where the super Brocoli appears on the game screen. If the player manages to catch the Super Brocoli before it disappears they will get an extra life.
